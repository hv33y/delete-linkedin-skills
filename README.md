# LinkedIn Profile Skills Removal

## Features
A Script to mass remove skills from own LinkedIn Profile you've already added.

## Browser compatibility
Supported in effectively all browsers.

## How

Use the scripts provided here to delete posts, comments and likes:

1. open your web browser;
2. go to the correct Linkedin page (see below);
3. open the browser's JavaScript console;
4. paste the corresponding script in the JavaScript console;
5. execute it!

Bam! New Linkedin, new life.

**Note:** these scripts have only been tested on a pretty recent version of Firefox. Let me know if they break on other browsers and I'll do my best to fix them. (Unless it's Internet Explorer, in which case you're on your own...)

### Posts

> Done!
